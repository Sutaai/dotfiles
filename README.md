# Sutaai's Dotfiles

This is my collection of dotfiles I am using for my differents computers.

It is compatible with Linux only. No Windows support will be (ever) added.
If you want to try it yourself and do a mix of both, I highly suggest you check out [this dotfiles collection](https://github.com/jeandeaual/dotfiles).

## Features

For a complete list of featuers, see the README.features.md.

* Fish shell with OhMyFish & Starship prompt
* Better kickstart (With config settings) for Zed's editor
* Attempt to be as customizable as possible for anyone (You apply it, you get to choose how you want things)
